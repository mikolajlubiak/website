I've been using Linux for about 5 years as a daily driver and on several servers. I also used \*BSD as a daily driver and on my NAS for 2 years.
I am also interested in cybersecurity and cryptology. I managed to take control of the NeuroN Foundation servers: https://web.archive.org/web/20230902084403/http://neuronfoundation.com/
So I have programming skills as well as quasi-sysadmin and quasi-pentester skills.

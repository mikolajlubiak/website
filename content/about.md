# Hi 👋, I'm Mikołaj

### Backend developer interested in cryptology🔑, system administration💻, cybersecurity🛡 and open source🄯.

- 🧑‍💻️ I’m doing an internship at the [NeuroN Foundation](https://neuronfoundation.com/), which [I hacked](https://web.archive.org/web/20230902084403/http://neuronfoundation.com/).

- 📝 I'm currently doing commissions for [Sealcode](https://www.sealcode.it/) and [Go2Ops](https://go2ops.com/).

	- Linux
	- \*BSD

- 🐍 My main programming languages are:
	- Python
	- C++
	- Go

- 🦀 Following Gynvael Coldwind's advice, I wrote some hello world programs like HTTP servers, or games in many other languages, including:
	- Lua
	- PHP
	- Shell
	- Rust
	- Zig
	- Nim
	- Nasm
	- Fasm

- 🗄 All of my projects are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/mikolajlubiak) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/mikolajlubiak).

- 📰 I write articles on [my website](https://lubiak.pages.dev/) when I have something interesting to say.

- 📬 You can get in contact with me by [email](mailto:lubiak@proton.me) ([PGP key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=lubiak%40proton.me)) or [Matrix protocol](https://matrix.to/#/@galanonim:matrix.org).

- 📄 If you consider hiring me, here is my [resume](https://lubiak.pages.dev/resume.pdf).

- 🎉 Fun facts: I'm interested in conlangs, I know Esperanto. [I'm not that bad at chess.♟️](https://lichess.org/@/funtoomen) I can solve Rubik's cube quite fast.

I've been using Linux for about 5 years as a daily driver and on several servers. I was using OpenBSD as a daily driver and on my NAS for about 2 years.
I'm interested in cybersecurity and cryptology. I managed to take full control of the NeuroN Foundation's servers: https://web.archive.org/web/20230902084403/http://neuronfoundation.com/ .
So I have programming skills as well as Unix-like systems administration and cybersecurity skills.

## Weird signals
When my friend was playing around with SDR, he found weird signals at frequency 000.493.998.750. He noticed that these weird signals only appeared when his phone was near the antenna, and that those signals were only sent when he did some action on the phone. This led him to believe that phones send signals when you do something inside them. The signal is very short-range; it only lasts a couple of centimeters.

## Conspiracy theory
*Conspiracy warning*: His theory is that phones send those signals and other devices around read them and, if able, send them to some three-letter agency’s servers.

## But for real
I tried to do some research and could not find anything about phones sending signals over this frequency; actually, I couldn’t find anything about this frequency. I honestly don’t believe in this theory, and I think it has a simpler explanation, but I couldn’t find it.
